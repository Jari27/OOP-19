# OOP Repository
This repository was adapted from the course Object Oriented Programming at the University of Groningen. Each directory contains a single, self-contained project/assignment.

HelloWorld contains an application that remembers some input and responds if an input is repeated.

RPG contains a simple text-based RPG. It can save the current state of the game.

CardGame contains our version of a drinking game, where the player has to select the correct card in two tries (or drinks). There's a small solitaire-like special effect at the end.

Finally, GraphEditor contains a simple GraphEditor. You can edit vertices, edges, vertex names, and the position of all vertices. Additionally, it incorporates selection, multi-selection, dragging, saving and loading.
